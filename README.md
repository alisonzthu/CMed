## Project Development Summary

### Implementation
1. Used Fetch API combined with Promise.all to retrieve data from ACCESS GUDID API

2. Presented required data in table. An id number, agency name and UDI are also attached to improve data readability, thus better user experience

3. Moved UDI and table head into separate files for code modularity and maintainability

4. Made UDI visible when hover on desktop or tap on the mobile phone

### Styling
1. Used CSS media query to achieve two major different views on desktop (wide screen) and mobile phones

2. Implemented a spinner. Therefore, before data is fully retrieved from API users will know our platform is working behind the scene
